      <p>
        I am a PhD candidate in Polymer Chemistry at the University of Connecticut, working in the
        <a href="{{ site.lab_url }}" target="_blank">{{ site.lab_name }}</a> under the supervision of
        <a href="{{ site.lab_url }}" target="_blank">{{ site.advisor }}</a>. My research focuses on
        developing advanced polymer materials, with particular emphasis on graphene-based composites
        and coatings.

        Before joining UConn, I completed both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Polymer Engineering
        at Amir Kabir University of Technology in Tehran, Iran. My academic journey has been complemented
        by hands-on industry experience as a Quality Control Engineer at Karya Polymer Co., where I
        developed cost-effective methods for characterizing plastic products and collaborated with
        production and R&D teams.

        I am passionate about developing sustainable materials that minimize environmental impact while
        maintaining high performance. My work combines fundamental polymer science with practical
        engineering approaches, drawing from my experience in both industrial and academic settings.
        I am particularly interested in finding cost-effective methods to advance materials science
        while building collaborative research teams.
